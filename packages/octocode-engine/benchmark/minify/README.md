# Real-Code Minifier Benchmark

This directory records before/after excerpts and metrics for one real sample per
discovered extension. Full third-party source files are not vendored here; use
the generator to recreate reports from a local corpus.

## Summary

- Samples covered: 46
- Symbol skeletons returned: 32/32
- Average cuts: content-view 27.7%, apply 31.8%, async 31.8%

## Competitor Baseline

This benchmark rates Octocode as an agent-context compressor. Production
compiler and bundler minifiers are the right baseline for deployable output:

| Competitor | Best At | Octocode Position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Terser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/terser) | Production JavaScript parsing, compression, mangling, and formatting. | Used for JS/CJS/MJS and stronger JS-family paths where safe. |
| [esbuild](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild) | Very fast JS/TS/CSS bundling and minification. | Better for production builds; Octocode avoids adding it as a runtime dependency. |
| [SWC](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swc/core) | Rust-backed JS/TS compilation transforms. | Better compiler-grade path; Octocode uses TypeScript transform plus guarded minification. |
| [Lightning CSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lightningcss) | Parser-grade CSS transforms and minification. | Better production CSS optimizer; Octocode uses CleanCSS async and lightweight sync cleanup. |
| [html-minifier-terser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-minifier-terser) | HTML minification with embedded asset options. | Used for async HTML; content-view still prioritizes readable agent context. |

## Real Minification Type Matrix

## Grammar-working check

`check-grammars.mjs` proves every tree-sitter grammar the engine declares as
supported is actually loaded into the **shipped native binary** and works
end-to-end through the napi surface — catching ABI mismatches that only surface
at parse time, not compile time (grammar crates are pinned at mixed versions —
0.7, 0.23, 0.24, 0.25, 0.26, 1.0 — against tree-sitter core 0.26).

```bash
yarn build:dev          # or any target — produces the .node binary
yarn grammars:check     # runs node benchmark/check-grammars.mjs
```

For each of the 19 distinct grammars it runs:

1. **CONTRACT** — the extension is in `getSupportedStructuralExtensions()`, and
   its presence in `getSupportedSignatureExtensions()` matches its tier.
2. **PARSE** — `structuralSearch(<benchmark sample>, "$$$")` yields nodes
   (`$$$` matches any node sequence, so `>0` means the real sample parsed).
3. **MATCH** — `structuralSearch(<canonical snippet>, <pattern>)` resolves the
   expected metavars (proves the query engine, not just the parser).
4. **SIGNATURE** — signature-tier grammars must return a non-empty skeleton from
   `extractSignatures(<canonical snippet>)`. The real sample is also run, but a
   null result is a **warning** (the excerpt may lack function bodies to strip),
   not a failure.

A coverage pass asserts every extension in
`getSupportedStructuralExtensions()` is claimed by exactly one grammar entry, so
adding a grammar to the engine without a `benchmark/<lang>/` sample + proof here
fails the check. It is wired into `yarn verify`.

> Note: tree-sitter is the **only** signature path. The former regex-heuristic
> extractor (`src/signatures/heuristic.rs`, outlines for Scala/Kotlin/Ruby/PHP/…)
> was orphaned — not wired into `extractSignatures` and reachable only by its own
> unit tests — and has been deleted. Older `<lang>/symbol/signatures.txt`
> artifacts for heuristic-only languages were generated by that since-removed
> path and do not reflect current behavior.
