# Memory Recall Workflow

Read this before planning, editing, recording, superseding, or trusting a remembered fact. Ranking and semantic behavior live in `references/memory-ranking.md`; output selection lives in `references/output-routing.md`.

## Recall

`memory recall` reads canonical SQLite rows, not `.octocode/MEMORY.md`. Run it when prior lessons may change the plan:

```bash
octocode-awareness memory recall --query "<task>" --workspace "$PWD" --smart --compact
```

Useful filters:

- Applicability: `--workspace`, `--artifact`, `--repo`, `--ref`; add `--strict-scope` for exact-only or `--global-only` for unscoped rows.
- Kind: repeat `--label`, `--tag`, or lifecycle `--state`; default state is `ACTIVE`.
- Provenance: repeat `--file`, `--file-regex`, `--reference`, or broad `--regex`.
- Time/value: `--as-of`, `--min-importance`, `--limit`, `--sort`.
- Judgment: `--smart`, `--semantic`, `--explain`.

Use `schema json-schema get_memory` when payload fields matter. CLI flags and schema names can differ, such as `--file` versus stored arrays.

## Trust And Recording

A hit is a lead. Current user instructions, source, tests, and fresh command output win. Validate file-backed claims and inspect `missing_references`/`query files` before acting.

Record only a scoped, reusable, evidence-backed lesson, decision, gotcha, or source lead. Routine status belongs in tasks/signals/refinements, not memory.

If new evidence corrects an active row, use `memory record --supersedes <id>` so the old row becomes `SUPERSEDED`. Use `memory forget --dry-run` for stale rows that should be deleted; keep raw IDs and scope narrow.

## Closure

- Zero results mean broaden vocabulary/filtering or use `--smart`; they do not prove absence.
- A low-confidence result with `judgment_required` needs more evidence before use.
- After using a memory, verify the claim in current context.
- When the claim changes, supersede/forget it and regenerate projections only if future readers need the update in files.

Use recall to inform the plan; proof comes from current artifacts and checks.
