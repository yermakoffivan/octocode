# Octocode Awareness Harness

**Audience**: maintainers, host integrators, and agents that need the full awareness flow without reading every source file.

The harness is the operating system around `@octocodeai/octocode-awareness`: a shared SQLite store in the global Octocode home, a CLI, installable Agent Skill scripts, host hooks, file locks, reflection, and generated workspace `.octocode/` repo context. The database is canonical. Hooks and generated docs are projections over it.

## System Surfaces

| Surface | Role |
|---|---|
| Agent Skill | Teaches agents when to attend, claim, verify, reflect, and hand off. |
| CLI | Canonical command surface for users, hooks, scripts, and host integrations. |
| Hooks / Pi bridge | Automates file claims, verification gates, smart briefings, and session capture. |
| SQLite store | Canonical source under the global Octocode home for memories, tasks, locks, verification, signals, refinements, edit audit, and harness events. |
| Workspace `.octocode/` projections | Optional generated repo context: Markdown, CSV, HTML, manifest, and compact references. |

Context and tokens are the circulation layer of the harness: `attend --compact` carries enough fresh state into the run, while `query workboard`, CSV, HTML, and manifest budgets keep row-heavy context from turning into overweight docs.

## Full Flow

```text
ATTEND -> CLAIM -> WORK -> VERIFY -> REFLECT -> PROJECT -> HAND OFF
```

| Step | Main command group | What is stored |
|---|---|---|
| Attend | `attend`, `query workboard`, `workspace status`, `memory recall`, `refinement get`, `signal list` | Reads `agents`, `memories`, `tasks`, `locks`, `signals`, `refinements`, and projection health. |
| Claim | `lock acquire`, `lock wait` | Creates `tasks` and `locks`. |
| Work | host editor / agent tool | Optional `edit_log` entries if the host records edit audit data. |
| Verify | `verify mark`, `verify audit` | Updates `tasks`; writes `task_log` events. |
| Reflect | `reflect record`, `memory record` | Writes `memories`, `memory_refs`, `harness_log`, optional `refinements`. |
| Project | `query`, `repo inject`, `docs staleness` | Reads DB views; writes generated `.octocode/` files; optional `harness_log` doc refresh proposals. |
| Hand off | `signal publish`, `session capture`, `refinement set` | Writes `signals`, `signal_reads`, `sessions`, `refinements`. |

## Improvement Loop

The self-improvement loop is advisory by design:

```text
reflect record
  -> memories + harness_log
  -> reflect mine-weakness
  -> reflect export-harness
  -> human review
  -> approved doc/skill edit
  -> future sessions recall the lesson
```

No command automatically patches `AGENTS.md`, `SKILL.md`, or package docs. `export-harness` emits candidates; a human or agent applies approved changes under normal review and verification.

## Current Improvement Direction

The current product slice is **attend + workboard**: a read-only start packet and row/column view that choose among the existing planning surfaces and return traceable evidence, gaps, verification targets, and bloat warnings.

This is deliberately smaller than a new memory architecture. It builds on the current flow:

```text
attend + query workboard + memory recall + query views + refinements/signals
  -> trace + evidence + gaps + verification targets + projection health
```

Future navigation can deepen the trace, but it should stay deterministic until fixtures prove a harder policy is needed. See [MEMORY_NAVIGATION.md](https://github.com/bgauryy/octocode-mcp/blob/main/packages/octocode-awareness/docs/MEMORY_NAVIGATION.md) for the tradeoff matrix and MVP boundary.

## Canonical Invariants

- The SQLite DB under the global Octocode home is source of truth; generated workspace `.octocode/` files are readable projections.
- Rows should be scoped by `workspace_path`; use `artifact`, `repo`, and `ref` when a finer scope matters.
- Agents should claim files before editing and verify before reporting success.
- `SUCCESS` requires verification. Unverified success releases are stored as `PENDING` until `verify mark`.
- Lock TTL is a safety net, not a coordination policy. Prefer release, wait, signal, or prune explicitly.
- Memories are leads. Current source, tests, user instructions, and fresh verification beat remembered context.
- Harness edits are gated: `OCTOCODE_ALLOW_HARNESS_APPLY=1` plus a non-main branch.
