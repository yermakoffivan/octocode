# Octocode Query Language

<oql_system_prompt id="octocode-oql-v1" version="oql/v1" audience="agents">

<section id="purpose">

## Purpose

OQL is the typed research query object behind `octocode search`.

Implementation status: this file is the contract to implement. Until the OQL
runner lands, existing quick commands and raw `tools <name>` calls remain the
current execution surface.

This document is both:

- an implementation contract for OQL V1;
- a system-prompt style guide for agents that need to construct, normalize,
  explain, execute, and continue research queries.

Future work lives in:
https://github.com/bgauryy/octocode/blob/main/docs/octocode-language/OCTOCODE_QUERY_LANGUAGE_PLAN.md

<section id="attention">

## Attention

<attention priority="highest">

Use **canonical OQL** for implementation. Accept sugar only at the CLI/API edge,
then normalize it before planning. `octocode search --explain` must show the
canonical query that actually runs.

</attention>

<must>

- Use one universal runner: `octocode search`.
- Use one canonical shape: `target`, `from`, `scope`, `where.kind`,
  `materialize`, `fetch`, `select`, `view`, `controls`, result bounds, and
  `explain`.
- Make every `where` leaf a discriminated predicate with `kind`.
- Keep path validation and secret sanitization in every execution path.
- Return typed diagnostics and executable continuations.

</must>

<must_not>

- Do not invent backend behavior.
- Do not drop predicates.
- Do not silently materialize.
- Do not silently run LSP.
- Do not silently run a weaker query.
- Do not treat provider zero results as proof unless every predicate was
  evaluated by the provider.
- Do not mutate files from OQL V1.

</must_not>

## Agent Decision Loop

<agent_loop>

1. Identify the research target: `code`, `content`, `structure`, or `files`.
   For V2-only research surfaces such as semantic/LSP navigation, repositories,
   packages, PR/history, binary, or diff, use the reserved target map in this
   document and expect V1 to return a typed `unsupportedTarget` diagnostic.
2. Identify the corpus in `from`.
3. Bound the corpus in `scope`.
4. Express the logical question in `where.kind`.
5. Decide whether external-to-local execution is allowed through
   `materialize.mode`.
6. Choose output density with `view`, projection with `select`, and cost
   controls with `controls`.
7. Run or request `--explain`.
8. Follow executable `next.*` continuations instead of inventing paths, pages,
   offsets, or follow-up queries.
9. Treat diagnostics as evidence about capability and completeness.

</capability_matrix>

<coverage_rules>

- V1 is complete for code/content/structure/files across local and GitHub,
  including AST, PCRE2, exact content proof, pagination, and bounded
  remote-as-local execution.
- V1 is not complete for all existing Octocode commands. It must say this
  explicitly through `unsupportedTarget` rather than pretending those commands
  already have OQL parity.
- Reserved V2 target families must reuse the same top-level grammar:
  `target`, `from`, `scope`, `where`, `materialize`, `fetch`, `select`, `view`,
  `controls`, diagnostics, provenance, and continuations.
- Do not create a new mini-language for LSP, npm, history, binary, or diff.
  Add typed target-specific fields only when the common grammar cannot express
  the operation.

## Borrow And Defer

<borrow_defer_matrix>

| Prior art | Borrow now | Defer |
|---|---|---|
| ripgrep | literal/regex/PCRE2, globs, ignores, hidden files, context, counts, only-matching, match pages, multiline, caps | replacements, encodings, compressed-file search as search, unrestricted binary search |
| ast-grep | code-shaped `pattern`, JSON `rule`, `kind`, `inside`, `has`, `not`, `all`, `any`, `stopBy:"end"` | `precedes`, `follows`, `field`, `regex`, `nthChild`, `range`, `matches`, utility rules, strictness modes |
| Semgrep | explicit rule evaluation language and future metavariable constraints | Semgrep-compatible syntax, `focus`, `fix`, `transform`, taint in V1 |
| CodeQL | separation between syntax proof and flow proof | dataflow/taint until an engine can return traces and proof provenance |
| GitHub/Sourcegraph search | typed provider filters and cheap path/code pushdown | string DSL compatibility, provider `symbol:` as reference proof, `select` changing result domains |
| LSP | position-based semantic operations, server capability diagnostics | treating symbol-name search as proof without a real file/line anchor |

</borrow_defer_matrix>

<borrow_defer_rules>

- OQL is a typed research object, not a string DSL.
- `select` is projection only. It must not deduplicate, change result domains, or
  trigger hidden fetches.
- AST proves syntax shape. LSP proves semantic relations. Dataflow proves flow
  only after a flow engine returns traces.
- Provider-specific filters are pushdown opportunities, not proof unless the
  provider can evaluate the exact predicate.

</borrow_defer_rules>

<section id="canonical-query">

## Canonical Query

<canonical_schema>

```ts
interface OqlQueryV1 {
  schema: "oql/v1"
  target: "code" | "content" | "structure" | "files"
  from: QuerySource
  scope?: QueryScope
  where?: Predicate
  materialize?: MaterializePolicy
  fetch?: FetchInstructions
  select?: SelectField[]
  view?: "discovery" | "paginated" | "detailed"
  controls?: QueryControls
  limit?: number
  page?: number
  itemsPerPage?: number
  explain?: boolean
}

interface OqlBatchV1 {
  schema: "oql/v1"
  queries: OqlQueryV1[]
  combine?: "independent" | "merge"
  limit?: number
  page?: number
  itemsPerPage?: number
  explain?: boolean
}

type OqlSearchInputV1 = OqlQueryV1 | OqlBatchV1

type SelectField = string
```

</canonical_schema>

<field_contract>

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema` | language version; omitted input normalizes to `oql/v1` |
| `target` | result family |
| `from` | corpus identity |
| `scope` | allowed corpus slice |
| `where` | logical match predicate |
| `materialize` | permission and strategy for external-to-local execution |
| `fetch` | bytes, tree, or content acquisition options |
| `select` | returned fields |
| `view` | output density, not match semantics |
| `controls` | budget, paging domains, ranking, snippets, debug |
| `limit`, `page`, `itemsPerPage` | result-level bounds |
| `explain` | return plan and normalized query |

</field_contract>

<bulk_contract>

`octocode search` accepts one canonical query or a bounded batch. Batching is
for independent research slices, not hidden cross-query logic.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `queries` | ordered list of OQL queries; V1 should use the existing tool-call cap of 1-5 queries |
| `combine:"independent"` | default; return one result envelope per query |
| `combine:"merge"` | merge compatible rows only after each query keeps its own provenance and diagnostics |
| batch `limit`, `page`, `itemsPerPage` | outer bounds for merged rendering; inner query bounds still apply |
| batch `explain` | explain every child query and the batch merge plan |

Rules:

- Query order is stable.
- A failed query does not erase successful sibling results.
- Each query gets its own diagnostics, provenance, evidence, pagination, and
  continuations.
- `combine:"merge"` is valid only when all child queries return compatible
  result rows. Otherwise return `invalidQuery` with a repair hint to use
  `combine:"independent"`.

</bulk_contract>

<target_contract>

| Target | Required | Optional | Does not use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `code` | `from`, `where` | `scope`, `materialize`, `select`, `view`, `controls`, result bounds | `fetch.content`, `fetch.tree` unless emitted as continuation |
| `content` | `from` | `fetch.content`, `select`, `view`, result bounds | `where` except future normalized match sugar |
| `structure` | `from` | `scope.path`, `fetch.tree`, `select`, `view`, result bounds | `where` except field/path filters after implementation supports them |
| `files` | `from` | `scope`, field/text/regex/structural `where`, `select`, `view`, result bounds | `fetch.content` |

</target_contract>

<evaluation_units>

Every predicate is evaluated against a target-specific unit. The planner must
preserve this unit when it pushes down, materializes, or filters results.

| Target | Evaluation unit | `where` omitted |
|---|---|---|
| `code` | a concrete code match occurrence | invalid |
| `content` | a bounded content block/file read | allowed; fetch-only |
| `structure` | a tree entry or directory slice | allowed; tree-only |
| `files` | a file or directory entry | allowed; list files in scope |

Rules:

- On `target:"code"`, text/regex/structural predicates return match rows.
- On `target:"files"`, text/regex/structural predicates mean the file contains
  at least one matching occurrence. `not` over those predicates means the file
  contains no such occurrence.
- Negative file queries require a complete candidate universe. For provider
  sources, that usually means materialization or a diagnostic.
- `where` omission is not a wildcard for `target:"code"`. Agents must provide a
  real code predicate.

</evaluation_units>

<top_level_bounds>

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `limit` | maximum logical result count before or with pagination |
| `page` | result page number for result rows/files/entries |
| `itemsPerPage` | result rows/files/entries per page |
| `explain` | include normalized query, defaults, routing, diagnostics, budgets, and backend plan |

</top_level_bounds>

<select_contract>

`select` is an array of result field names and continuation names. It projects
output only; it must not cause hidden unbounded fetches.

| Field | Use |
|---|---|
| `repo` | GitHub repository identity |
| `localPath` | materialized local path |
| `path` | file or tree path |
| `line` | start line for code/content evidence |
| `endLine` | end line when a result spans lines |
| `column` | start column when available |
| `snippet` | bounded code/search snippet |
| `content` | bounded content body for `target:"content"` |
| `metavars` | structural captures |
| `size` | file/tree size when available |
| `modified` | file modification time when available |
| `pagination` | pagination state for the active result domain |
| `diagnostics` | result-local diagnostics |
| `next.*` | executable continuation handles |

Rules:

- Unknown select fields produce `unknownField` or `unsupportedPredicate`.
- `select:["content"]` is valid only for bounded content results.
- Search rows should select `next.fetch` instead of full content.

</select_contract>

## Source And Scope

<source_schema>

```ts
type QuerySource =
  | { kind: "local"; path: string }
  | { kind: "github"; owner?: string; repo?: string; ref?: string }
  | { kind: "materialized"; localPath: string; source?: QuerySource }
```

</source_schema>

<source_params>

| Source field | Required when | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | always | source discriminator |
| `path` | local source | local file or directory root |
| `owner` | optional GitHub source | GitHub user/org scope for search |
| `repo` | optional GitHub source | `owner/name` repository id, or repository name when `owner` is set |
| `ref` | optional GitHub source | branch, tag, or commit |
| `localPath` | materialized source | local path returned by materialization |
| `source` | optional materialized source | original provider source |

</source_params>

<scope_schema>

```ts
interface QueryScope {
  path?: string | string[]
  language?: string | string[]
  include?: string[]
  exclude?: string[]
  excludeDir?: string[]
  hidden?: boolean
  noIgnore?: boolean
  maxDepth?: number
}
```

</scope_schema>

<scope_params>

| Scope field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `path` | source-relative traversal root or provider path prefix |
| `language` | canonical language filter; normalizes CLI `--type` and raw `langType` |
| `include` | include globs for local/materialized search |
| `exclude` | exclude globs when backend supports them |
| `excludeDir` | directory names to skip entirely |
| `hidden` | include hidden files when backend supports it |
| `noIgnore` | ignore `.gitignore`/ignore files when backend supports it |
| `maxDepth` | tree/file traversal depth |

</scope_params>

<rules>

- `from` identifies the corpus.
- Repository subpaths belong in `scope.path`.
- Local paths must pass existing path validation.
- GitHub `repo` should be `owner/name` for repository-scoped reads. The split
  form `{owner, repo}` is accepted sugar and normalizes to `owner/name`.
- GitHub `owner` without `repo` scopes code/repository search to one owner.
- GitHub `from:{kind:"github"}` with neither `owner` nor `repo` means provider
  search across GitHub. It is valid only for provider-search targets and must
  never be materialized.
- GitHub content, structure, and materialization require a concrete repository.
- GitHub `ref` is branch, tag, or commit.
- OQL uses canonical `language`; CLI `--type` and raw `langType` normalize to
  it.
- Path and language constraints are scope, not `controls`.
- `scope.path` narrows the traversal root or provider prefix. It is not the
  proof language for path matching.
- Use `where:{kind:"field",field:"path",op:"glob"}` or
  `where:{kind:"field",field:"path",op:"regex"}` when exact path intent matters.
- Glob semantics are local/materialized by default. Provider-native path
  qualifiers that are only prefix filters must be reported as approximate unless
  a local/materialized residual check proves them.
- Unsupported scope fields become diagnostics unless the planner can route to a
  local/materialized lane.
- For V1 structural search, current local execution supports `include`,
  `excludeDir`, language-derived includes, and `maxFiles`; other scope fields
  must be diagnostic or residual-planned before they affect proof.

</rules>

</section>

<section id="predicates">

## Predicates

<attention priority="high">

`where` is a discriminated union. Every predicate leaf must have `kind`.

</attention>

<predicate_union>

```ts
type Predicate =
  | { kind: "all"; id?: PredicateId; of: Predicate[] }
  | { kind: "any"; id?: PredicateId; of: Predicate[] }
  | { kind: "not"; id?: PredicateId; predicate: Predicate }
  | TextPredicate
  | RegexPredicate
  | StructuralPredicate
  | FieldPredicate

type PredicateId = string
```

</predicate_union>

<boolean_predicates>

| Predicate | Fields | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `all` | `of: Predicate[]` | every child predicate must match |
| `any` | `of: Predicate[]` | at least one child predicate must match |
| `not` | `predicate: Predicate` | child predicate must not match |

Rules:

- Empty `all.of` or `any.of` is invalid.
- `not` must contain exactly one child predicate.
- Predicate IDs are optional input. The compiler must assign stable IDs to every
  predicate node before planning so `--explain`, diagnostics, and provenance can
  refer to exact nodes.
- Canonical boolean nodes are only `all`, `any`, and `not`.
- Providers may not support all boolean forms; unsupported forms become
  diagnostics or route to materialized/local execution.

</boolean_predicates>

<boolean_sugar>

Accepted sugar must normalize away before planning:

| Sugar | Canonical rewrite |
|---|---|
| `and` | `all` |
| `or` | `any` |
| `noneOf:[A,B]` | `not(any(A,B))` |
| `xor:[A,B]` | `any(all(A,not(B)), all(not(A),B))` |
| `oneOf:[A,B,...]` | exactly-one expansion, or `unsupportedPredicate` if expansion exceeds the V1 budget |

Rules:

- `xor` is not a backend feature.
- `xor` over provider sources requires a complete candidate universe or
  materialization, because the planner must prove both positive and negative
  branches.
- Boolean normalization should flatten nested `all`/`any`, remove double
  negation, and apply De Morgan rewrites only when they do not change the
  evaluation unit or proof strength.

</boolean_sugar>

<residual_logic_rules>

| Boolean shape | Safe routing rule |
|---|---|
| `all(PUSHDOWN, RESIDUAL)` | push down the supported predicates, then residual-filter candidates |
| `any(PUSHDOWN, RESIDUAL)` | requires union coverage; if the residual branch cannot enumerate candidates, materialize or fail |
| `not(P)` | exact only when the planner has the full evaluation universe for the target |
| `xor(A,B)` sugar | exact only when both branches and their negations are exact over the same universe |

Rules:

- Boolean trees must not be flattened into one global pushed/residual/routed
  list if that loses parent/child semantics.
- `--explain` must show routing per predicate node, not only per backend call.
- A residual predicate under `not`, `any`, or `xor` cannot produce `proof` unless
  the candidate universe is complete.

</residual_logic_rules>

<predicate kind="text">

### Text

```ts
interface TextPredicate {
  id?: PredicateId
  kind: "text"
  value: string
  case?: "smart" | "sensitive" | "insensitive"
  wholeWord?: boolean
}
```

<text_params>

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kind:"text"` | literal text predicate |
| `value` | exact text to search for |
| `case` | case behavior; `smart` follows current local ripgrep behavior |
| `wholeWord` | match whole words only when backend supports it |

</text_params>

Rules:

- `text` means literal text.
- Local compilation sets `fixedString:true`.
- Default `case` is `smart`, matching current local ripgrep behavior.
- Provider text search may not support exact local case behavior; unsupported
  parts must appear in `diagnostics`.

</predicate>

<predicate kind="regex">

### Regex

```ts
interface RegexPredicate {
  id?: PredicateId
  kind: "regex"
  value: string
  dialect?: "rust" | "pcre2" | "provider"
  case?: "smart" | "sensitive" | "insensitive"
  wholeWord?: boolean
  multiline?: boolean
  dotAll?: boolean
}
```

<regex_params>

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kind:"regex"` | regular-expression predicate |
| `value` | regex pattern string |
| `dialect` | `rust` for local default, `pcre2` for advanced local regex, `provider` for provider-native search |
| `case` | case behavior; unsupported provider behavior must be diagnosed |
| `wholeWord` | wrap or lower to whole-word matching when backend supports it |
| `multiline` | allow matching across lines when backend supports it |
| `dotAll` | make `.` match newlines when backend supports it |

</regex_params>

Rules:

- Default local dialect is `rust`.
- `pcre2` requires local or materialized execution.
- Lookaround and backreferences require `dialect:"pcre2"`.
- Provider regex support is provider-specific and must be explained.

</predicate>

<predicate kind="structural">

### Structural

```ts
interface StructuralPredicate {
  id?: PredicateId
  kind: "structural"
  lang: string
  pattern?: string
  rule?: StructuralRule
}

interface StructuralRule {
  pattern?: string
  kind?: string
  inside?: StructuralRule
  has?: StructuralRule
  not?: StructuralRule
  all?: StructuralRule[]
  any?: StructuralRule[]
  stopBy?: "end"
}
```

<structural_params>

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kind:"structural"` | AST/tree-sitter predicate |
| `lang` | required parser language; use canonical language ids |
| `pattern` | code-shaped structural pattern |
| `rule` | JSON structural rule for relational matching |
| `rule.pattern` | nested code-shaped structural pattern |
| `rule.kind` | AST node kind constraint |
| `rule.inside` | ancestor/containing rule |
| `rule.has` | descendant/subtree rule |
| `rule.not` | negated nested rule |
| `rule.all` | every nested rule must match |
| `rule.any` | at least one nested rule must match |
| `rule.stopBy` | relational traversal boundary; use `"end"` for V1 relational rules |

</structural_params>

<structural_subset>

| Structural feature | V1 status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pattern` | active | code-shaped tree-sitter pattern |
| `$X` | active | one AST node capture |
| `$$$ARGS` / `$$$NAME` | active | node-list capture |
| `rule.pattern` | active | nested code-shaped pattern |
| `rule.kind` | active | AST node kind constraint |
| `rule.inside` | active | containing/ancestor relation |
| `rule.has` | active | descendant/subtree relation |
| `rule.not` | active | structural negation inside a rule |
| `rule.all` / `rule.any` | active | structural rule composition |
| `rule.stopBy:"end"` | active | required for bounded relational intent |

</structural_subset>

<structural_deferred>

| Feature | V1 handling |
|---|---|
| `precedes`, `follows`, `field`, `regex`, `nthChild`, `range`, `matches` | `unsupportedPredicate` unless the engine proves support later |
| reusable named structural refs | V2 |
| metavariable constraints and focus range | V2 |
| rule ids, messages, severities, tests | V2 |
| `fix`, `transform`, codemod output | V3 dry-run only |
| Semgrep or ast-grep compatibility mode | not V1 |

</structural_deferred>

Rules:

- Exactly one of `pattern` or `rule` is required.
- `lang` is required.
- `$X` captures one AST node.
- `$$$ARGS` captures a node list.
- Bare `$$$` is an advanced document-root probe, not normal agent syntax.
- Patterns must parse as complete source nodes. For example, a TypeScript class
  usually needs `class $NAME { $$$BODY }`, not `class $NAME`.
- The OQL compiler may serialize `rule` to the current engine's YAML rule
  string, but agents should use the JSON object form.
- OQL structural rules are Octocode tree-sitter rules. They are not full
  ast-grep or Semgrep compatibility.
- Structural search is local-only. GitHub structural queries need
  `materialize.mode:"auto"` or `"required"`.
- Rule ids, messages, severities, tests, reusable refs, and fixes are not V1.

</predicate>

<predicate kind="field">

### Field

```ts
interface FieldPredicate {
  id?: PredicateId
  kind: "field"
  field:
    | "path"
    | "basename"

    | ">="
    | "<"
    | "<="
    | "within"
  value?: unknown
}
```

<field_params>

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kind:"field"` | file/result attribute predicate |
| `field` | file/result attribute to test |
| `op` | comparison operator |
| `value` | comparison value; omitted only for `op:"exists"` |

</field_params>

<field_operator_semantics>

| Operator | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `=` / `!=` | equality or inequality |
| `in` | field value is one of the provided values |
| `exists` | field is present |
| `glob` | glob comparison, mainly for path-like fields |
| `regex` | regex comparison, mainly for path-like fields |
| `>` / `>=` / `<` / `<=` | numeric or timestamp comparison |
| `within` | timestamp or size range comparison |

</field_operator_semantics>

<field_value_rules>

| Operator | Required value shape |
|---|---|
| `=` / `!=` | scalar string, number, or boolean matching the field type |
| `in` | non-empty array of scalar values matching the field type |
| `exists` | no `value` |
| `glob` | glob string; path separators normalize to `/` |
| `regex` | regex string; Rust regex unless the planner routes to PCRE2-capable local proof |
| `>` / `>=` / `<` / `<=` | number, size string, duration string, or ISO timestamp according to field type |
| `within` | `{ "from"?: value, "to"?: value }` or a duration string such as `"7d"` |

Rules:

- `extension` values normalize without a leading dot.
- `entryType` values are `"file"` or `"directory"` in OQL. Backends may lower
  them to their native forms such as `f` and `d`.
- Type mismatches produce `fieldTypeMismatch`.

</field_value_rules>

Rules:

- Field predicates are logical predicates, not output controls.
- `path`, `basename`, and `extension` may push down to GitHub when supported.
- `size`, `modified`, and `entryType` may require local/materialized execution
  depending on source and target.

| `mode:"auto"` | planner may materialize bounded source if needed |
| `mode:"required"` | planner must materialize first or fail |
| `strategy:"file"` | fetch/cache one file |
| `strategy:"tree"` | fetch/cache tree info |
| `strategy:"subtree"` | clone/fetch bounded subtree |
| `strategy:"repo"` | full repo, only when explicitly allowed and bounded |
| `forceRefresh` | bypass stale cache when supported |

</materialize_params>

<defaults>

- Local source: no materialization needed.
- GitHub source: `mode:"never"` unless the query explicitly sets otherwise.

</defaults>

<rules>

- `never`: provider-only. Local-only predicates produce
  `requiresMaterialization`.
- `auto`: planner may materialize a bounded repo/path/ref when needed.
- `required`: planner must materialize first or fail.
- Materialization requires bounded `repo`, `ref` when available, and `scope.path`
  unless the user explicitly allows a full repo.
- Materialized results must return `localPath`, original source, ref/cache
  information, and executable local follow-ups.

</rules>

<remote_as_local_flow>

One OQL query may plan a multi-step research flow:

1. Use provider search/tree/content to bound the candidate corpus.
2. Materialize the bounded file, subtree, or repository.
3. Run local proof tools over the materialized path: ripgrep, PCRE2,
   structural AST, exact content fetch, symbol-outline minification, and V2 LSP.
4. Return one result envelope with provenance for every step and continuations
   for exact reads, next pages, LSP follow-ups, or refresh.

This is the OQL form of current `grep --repo`: remote input, local proof.

Rules:

- The planner must not materialize broad GitHub/org/global scopes.
- `strategy:"repo"` requires explicit user intent or a small bounded repository.
- Current backing for GitHub materialization is `ghCloneRepo` with `owner`,
  `repo`, `branch`, `sparsePath`, and `forceRefresh`. Unsupported strategy or
  budget fields must produce diagnostics, not silent ignore.
- Provider zero results are not proof when the query asked for a local-only
  predicate such as PCRE2, structural AST, exact absence, or semantic proof.

| `content.contentView` | `exact`, `compact`, or `symbols` |
| `content.charOffset` | character offset for content pagination |
| `content.charLength` | maximum characters to return |
| `content.fullContent` | request full file only when bounded and allowed |
| `tree.maxDepth` | tree traversal depth |
| `tree.includeSizes` | include size info when backend supports it |

</fetch_params>

    maxCandidates?: number
    maxBytes?: number
    maxMaterializedBytes?: number
    timeoutMs?: number
  }
}
```

</controls_schema>

<controls_params>

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `search.filesOnly` | return matching files without snippets |
| `search.countLinesPerFile` | count matching lines per file |
| `search.countMatchesPerFile` | count total matches per file |
| `search.onlyMatching` | return matched substrings only |
| `search.unique` | unique matched substrings per file; requires `onlyMatching` |
| `search.countUnique` | unique matched substrings with counts; requires `onlyMatching` |
| `search.matchWindow` | characters around an `onlyMatching` hit |
| `search.matchContentLength` | maximum snippet length |
| `search.maxMatchesPerFile` | per-file match page size/cap |

| `budget.maxBytes` | maximum bytes to inspect/read |
| `budget.maxMaterializedBytes` | maximum external bytes to materialize |
| `budget.timeoutMs` | execution time budget |

</controls_params>

<rules>

- `fetch` acquires content or tree data.
- `controls` affects cost, pagination domains, snippets, ranking, and debug
  output.
- `controls` must not change what logically matches.
- Legacy `filesWithoutMatch` input is not canonical OQL. Normalize it to
  `target:"files"` plus `where:{kind:"not",predicate:...}`.
- `onlyMatching` is the safe way to enumerate values from minified one-line
  files.
- `matchPage` pages matches inside one file; top-level `page` pages result
  files/rows.
- Discovery/count modes still require exact fetch before quoting or patching.

</rules>

<content_view_mapping>

| OQL | Current backing | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `exact` | `minify:"none"` | quotes, patches, diffs |
| `compact` | `minify:"standard"` | normal reading |
| `symbols` | `minify:"symbols"` | cheap symbol/signature outline for orientation |

Rules:

- `contentView:"symbols"` is syntax/signature extraction from content. It is not
  LSP semantic proof.
- If symbol extraction falls back or is unsupported for a language, return
  `signatureUnsupported` or `partialResult` diagnostics and a content-fetch
  continuation.

## Normalization

<normalization_rule>

Input sugar is accepted only if it has a deterministic rewrite. Ambiguous sugar
must fail with a repair diagnostic. Canonical output from `--explain` must not
contain shorthand fields.

</normalization_rule>

<example kind="sugar">

```jsonc
{
  "repo": "facebook/react",
  "path": "packages/react",
  "pattern": "useEffect($$$ARGS)",
  "lang": "js"

| `provenance` | backend/source/predicate routing evidence |
| `evidence.answerReady` | true only when the result is strong enough to answer |

| Evidence kind | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `proof` | every required predicate was evaluated exactly over the required universe |
| `partial` | some pages, candidates, files, or residual checks remain |
| `candidate` | useful lead, but at least one predicate or provider filter is approximate |
| `unsupported` | planner could not execute the requested semantics |

Rules:

- `answerReady:true` requires `evidence.kind:"proof"` and
  `evidence.complete:true`, unless the user asked only for candidates.
- Per-result proof cannot upgrade whole-query proof if pagination, truncation,
  residual predicates, or unsupported boolean branches remain.
- Diagnostics that block proof must set `blocksAnswer:true`.
- A result with executable continuations is usually `partial` unless the
  continuation is optional enrichment.

## Reserved Extension Targets

<reserved_targets>

These target families are not valid V1 canonical targets. V1 must return
`unsupportedTarget` plus a repair continuation or current-tool hint. They are
reserved so V2/V3 extend the language without inventing another grammar.

| Target family | Backing surface | Required design rule |
|---|---|---|
| `semantics` | `lspGetSemantics`, `lsp` | position/capability based; do not treat plain symbol search as proof |
| `repositories` | `ghSearchRepos`, `repo` | typed GitHub filters, no string DSL dependency |
| `packages` | `npmSearch`, `pkg` | package-to-source-repo continuation |
| `pullRequests` | `ghHistoryResearch`, `pr` | page body/files/comments/reviews/commits independently |
| `commits` | `ghHistoryResearch`, `history` | path/date/branch scoped history and optional diff slices |
| `artifacts` | `localBinaryInspect`, `binary`, `unzip` | list/extract/decompress/strings/unpack with scan continuations |
| `diff` | `diff`, PR patch selectors | exact content ranges or selected patch hunks |
| `fixes` | future dry-run codemod | no mutation in V1/V2; V3 dry-run only |
| `dataflow` | future flow engine | candidate mode first, proof only with traces |

</reserved_targets>

<semantic_target_rules>

V2 semantic/LSP queries should use real anchors:

- `uri` or materialized local path;
- 1-based line and optional character/order hint;
- operation such as `definition`, `references`, `callers`, `callees`,
  `callHierarchy`, `hover`, `documentSymbols`, `typeDefinition`, or
  `implementation`;
- server capability and partial-result diagnostics.

Remote semantic queries must route through bounded materialization before LSP
runs. GitHub provider `symbol:`-style search can discover definitions, but it is
not reference, type, implementation, or call-hierarchy proof.

## Acceptance Gates

<acceptance_gates>

1. Every example in this file parses as `oql/v1`.
2. Every sugar example normalizes to the documented canonical shape.
3. Unknown fields fail.
4. V2/V3 targets fail with `unsupportedTarget`.
5. Local text compiles to `localSearchCode fixedString:true`.
6. Local regex compiles to Rust regex or PCRE2 as requested.
7. Local structural compiles to current structural search.
8. GitHub structural with `materialize:"never"` fails with
   `requiresMaterialization` or `materializationNotAllowed`.
9. GitHub structural with `materialize:"auto"` routes through bounded clone and
   then local structural search.
10. Every partial result returns an executable OQL continuation.
11. `--explain` shows normalized query, defaults, routing, budgets, and
    diagnostics.
12. Existing path validation and secret sanitization remain in the execution
    path.

## Future Work

V2 adds LSP remote-as-local, repository/package/PR/history/binary/diff targets,
quick-command lowering, reusable structural rule refs, rule validation, and
budget controls beyond V1's safety caps.

V2 also adds richer structural language only when supported by the engine:
reusable rule refs, metavariable constraints, focus ranges, rule validation,
and resolved rule provenance. Do not claim Semgrep or ast-grep compatibility
unless a compatibility layer is actually implemented.

V3 adds dry-run fixes and dataflow:

- `target:"fixes"` returns proposed edits, ranges, replacement text, conflicts,
  and metavariable provenance; it does not mutate files.
- `target:"dataflow"` starts as candidate mode with `flowKind:"value"` or
  `"taint"`, `sources`, `sinks`, `sanitizers`, and `propagators`.
- Candidate flow must return `evidence.kind:"candidate"` and a diagnostic that
  prevents vulnerability/proof claims.
- Engine-backed flow proof requires traces, source availability, truncation
  state, dependency bounds, and provenance.
- Global/cross-package taint is allowed only after the backing engine can prove
  it with bounded dependencies.
